- Added inline comments across the marketing and support HTML pages to explain their metadata, navigation, and helper styles for future maintainers.
- Expanded the chat interface layout so the transcript, toolbar, and composer occupy more of the viewport while keeping dark-mode support documented in the markup.
- Swapped duplicated hamburger markup for a single labelled navigation trigger on the landing page to clarify the mobile menu behaviour.
